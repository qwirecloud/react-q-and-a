# Frontend Hands-On Activity

This is the hands-on activity that the frontend candidate will do as part of the interview process for qwire. The goal of this activity is to evaluate the skills of the candidate by giving them a Pull Request, submitted by an imaginary junior frontend, so they can review the PR and provide guidance for this fellow developer.

## Context

Imagine you are working on a technical leadership position, or at least a very senior position, as a frontend developer on a company that, among other things, provides a task management system called Tachometer. You are not an integral member of the team that supports Tachometer but, Joana, the technical leader of the Tachometer team is going on vacation and asked you to help with the junior developer she have been mentoring.

One day, you get to your desk and you get the following message from this junior developer:

> Hey mate, [I have been working on this PR](https://github.com/brunokrebs/react-q-and-a/pull/1) for the last couple of weeks and now I think it is ready to ship. As Joana is still on vacation for a few days, I would like to know if you could review it for me so we can ship as soon as possible. There are a few features I'm shipping there. I tried to describe them on the PR description. Please, let me know your thoughts. Thanks!

Now, it is your turn to help shape the career of this young developer. Let's see how you can help them!

## Tips

> Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.

In other words, "install this library" is usually a bad tip as you don't teach the developer the problem they are facing/shipping.

## Running the Projects

You don't really need to run the projects to review their PR, but if you are insterested, you can do the following:

1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install` from the project root
3. `npm start`

Then, you will have to do a similar thing for the backend project that supports this React app:

1. [Clone the backend API](https://github.com/brunokrebs/node-q-and-a)
2. `npm install` from the project root
3. `npm start` from there
